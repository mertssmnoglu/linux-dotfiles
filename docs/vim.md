# Vim Configuration

## What is Vim?

Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient.
It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.

## Where should I locate the runtime config?

By default, vim uses `$USER/.vimrc`

## Configuration Steps

1. Copy the `.vimrc` into your home directory
2. Open vim into your terminal. eg: `vim .`
3. Use `:PlugInstall` command
4. (Optional) Close and re open vim
