# Firefox

I'm using **Tree Style Tab** extension with some custom css.

- Extension: [Tree Style Tab]()
- Custom CSS: [here](../firefox/chrome/userChrome.css)

## What is the custom css location?

1. Go to `about:profiles`
2. Accept the dialog if got any
3. Select the table which got `Default Profile: yes`
4. Open up the root directory of the selected table
5. Copy the Custom css into `chrome/userChrome.css`


## Conclusion

Now, you can only seeing the tree style tabs not the default tabs at the same time.
